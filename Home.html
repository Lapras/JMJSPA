    <p>Welcome to Jeremy Murray's Javascript Podium! Where I show what I learned in Web 1 during an independent study on this site!</p>
    <br>
    <p>This site is hosted using Netlify, a free site for hosting small sites like this one. The domain has been acquired through freenom, which allows for HTTPS, .tk .cf, and other domains that aren't as good as .com or .org, but they do the trick. On this site you'll find two pages, the magic 8 ball, my premier experience in mixing Javascript with HTML on a static server like netlfy, which will randomly generate yes or no answers to your questions, and store them for your visit. The next page is the meme gallery, which is really just a collection of my favorite memes, and a little side project to show some good HTML and CSS. Have fun! The whole code for the site is <a href="https://github.com/Lapras/JMJSPA"><u>on the following github repository.</u></a></p>
